# Software-Engineer-Course-Good-Demos

## 1. JdbcReview	:

* Check the screenshot. 
* Using user first name to get the ssn nunmber  
* Need to check the build path and turn on mysql.   
* A good JDBC demo with JavaFX.

## 2. Exercise_LoginAndAuthorization_Soln 

* Check the PDF. 
* A good demo about all you need to know on Login and Authorization using Java
* userid = 1   password = 1  private
* userid = 2   password = 2  admin

## 2.5 Exercise_Callback_Solution	

* Check the pdf.
* Check Alice's and Joe's teacher report and grade by logging in. 
* Their user name and password are their names.
* Callbacks are most easily described in terms of the telephone system. A function call is analogous to calling someone on a telephone, asking her a question, getting an answer, and hanging up; adding a callback changes the analogy so that after asking her a question, you also give her your name and number so she can call you back with the answer.

## 3. Exercise_RefactorControl_Soln	
* Check the comments from professor in UI classes.
* There are 3 solutions on the discussion of UI, controller and printer. The later demo is loosely coupled and controller does not even know the existance of ui using call back function.
* The design is made easier by requiring Control to be a singleton. Since a controller
 will typically be responsible for several
 windows, and it may have to manage relationships between data among many of these, it is
 often a good idea for a controller to be a singleton.

## 4. ArchAnFXRules
* Need to check the build path.
* A small working E-Bazaar demo about rules engine.
* The rules file is .clp. It is JEZZ-the rule engine for the Java Platform.

## 5. SampleDataAccessSubsystem		
* Need to check the build path.
